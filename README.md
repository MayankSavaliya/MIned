## 🎯 Problem Statement

The project addresses several key challenges in last-mile delivery optimization:

🔹 **Route Efficiency**: Optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicle types while minimizing travel distance and time

🔹 **Vehicle Constraints**: Handle different vehicle capacities and operational limitations:
  - Distance radius restrictions
  - Vehicle capacity limits
  - Time window constraints

🔹 **Real-time Processing**: Process and optimize routes in real-time without local storage dependencies

🔹 **Multi-Vehicle Strategy**: Efficiently assign deliveries across different vehicle types:
  - 3-Wheelers for narrow streets and short distances
  - Electric vehicles for eco-friendly medium-range deliveries
  - Standard 4-wheelers for longer routes and larger capacities

🔹 **Business Goals**:
  - Maximize vehicle utilization
  - Minimize delivery time
  - Optimize resource allocation
  - Reduce operational costs
